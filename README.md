# Term Deposit Subscription Prediction Project


## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources and setup guide for the Data Science project aimed at a comprehensive analysis of customer behavior based on the transactional data collected from ten stores for three months. The notebook in the repository guides you through the Exploratory Data Analysis of the dataset and derives valuable insights from it 

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **dataset/**: A Directory containing all the csv files related to the dataset
- **Term Deposit Subscription Prediction.ipynb**: The jupyter notebook file for this project. It contains the all the code for the project
- **README.md**: Comprehensive documentation about the project, including project overview, setup instructions, usage guide, and acknowledgments.
- **requirements.txt**: Text file listing all the Python packages required to run the code.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

4. Activate the virtual environment:
   1. On Windows:
      ```bash
      venv\Scripts\activate
   2. On macOS and Linux:
      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
5. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage Guide

The project can be used for the following purposes:

- Preprocessing the data, including handling missing values, duplicate values, dropping irrelevent columns etc
- Exploring the dataset and performing data analysis.
- Gaining valuable businesss insights from the analysis

Refer to the Jupyter notebook for detailed code and explanations.
